Haven't even been a day since I started this project, so there's still a lot to be done. Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/itsmatharoo) to catch all updates. You can also tweet suggestions at me.

To-do List:
------------

**App**

* Implement socket.io
    * Message persistence

**Talking**

* Text speech bubbles
    * Text typewriter animation

**Graphics**

* Update CSS
* New sprites
    * Talking animation

**Maybe List**

* Maybe, a room shows chats for all channels instead of one channel, where people in the same channel are grouped together
* Maybe, it shows all the chats from all the servers that the bot is in
* Maybe, the ability to edit user sprites and save them
