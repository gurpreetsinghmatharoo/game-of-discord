    `How can you see into my eyes like open doors
    Leading you down into my core
    Where I've become so numb without a soul
    My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
    Until you find it there and lead it back home
    Wake me up inside
    Wake me up inside
    Call my name and save me from the dark
    Bid my blood to run
    Before I come undone
    Save me from the nothing I've become
    Now that I know what I'm without
    You can't just leave me
    Breathe into me and make me real
    Bring me to life
    Wake me up inside
    Wake me up inside
    Call my name and save me from the dark
    Bid my blood to run
    Before I come undone
    Save me from the nothing I've become
    Bring me to life
    Bring me to life
    Frozen inside, without your touch
    Without your love, darling
    Only you are my life
    Among the dead
    I've been sleeping a thousand years it seems
    Got to open my eyes to everything
    Don't let me die her
    Bring, me, to, life
    Wake me up inside
    Wake me up inside
    Call my name and save me from the dark
    Bid my blood to run
    Before I come undone
    Save me from the nothing I've become
    Bring me to life`,

    Of alarm clocks screaming monsters calling my name
    Let me stay
    Where the wind will whisper to me
    Where the raindrops as they're falling tell a story
    In my field of paper flowers
    And candy clouds of lullaby
    I lie inside myself for hours
    And watch my purple sky fly over me
    Don't say I'm out of touch
    With this rampant chaos your reality
    I know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge
    The nightmare I built my own world to escape
    In my field of paper flowers
    And candy clouds of lullaby
    I lie inside myself for hours
    And watch my purple sky fly over me
    Swallowed up in the sound of my screaming
    Cannot cease for the fear of silent nights
    Oh how I long for the deep sleep dreaming
    The goddess of imaginary light
    In my field of paper flowers
    And candy clouds of lullaby
    I lie inside myself for hours
    And watch my purple sky fly over me`

    Couldn't hide the emptiness; you let it show
    Never wanted it to be so cold
    Just didn't drink enough to say you love me
    I can't hold on to me
    Wonder what's wrong with me

    Drown my will to fly
    Here in the darkness I know myself
    Can't break free until I let it go
    Let me go
    Darling, I forgive you after all
    Anything is better than to be alone
    And in the end I guess I had to fall
    Always find my place among the ashes
    I can't hold on to me
    Wonder what's wrong with me

    Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me

The mechanical lights of Lisbon frightened it away
And I'm alone now
Me and all I stood for, we're wandering now
Holdin' parts and pieces, swim lonely
Find your own way out
I can't see your star
I can't see your star
How can the darkness feel so wrong?
And I'm alone now
Me and all I stood for, we're wandering now
We're holdin' parts and pieces, swim lonely
Find your own way out
So far away
It's growing colder without your love
Why can't you feel me calling your name?
Can't break the silence, it's breaking me
All my fears turn to rage
And I'm alone now
Me and all I stood for, we're wandering now
We're holdin' parts and pieces, swim lonely
Find your own way out now
Hey, and nothing worth fighting for
We're wandering now
Holdin' parts and pieces, swim lonely
Find your own way out`

All that I'm dying for
All that I can't ignore alone at night
I can feel the night beginning
Separate me from the living
Understanding me
After all I've seen
Piecing every thought together
Find the words to make me better
If I only knew how to pull myself apart
All that I'm living for
All that I'm dying for
All that I can't ignore alone at night
All that I'm wanted for
Although I wanted more
Lock the last open door, my ghosts are gaining on me
I believe that dreams are sacred
Take my darkest fears and play them
Like a lullaby
Like a reason why
Like a play of my obsessions
Make me understand the lesson
So I'll find myself
So I won't be lost again
All that I'm living for
All that I'm dying for
All that I can't ignore alone at night
All that I'm wanted for
Although I wanted more
Lock the last open door, my ghosts are gaining on me
Guess I thought I'd have to change the world
To make you see me
To be the one
I could have run forever
But how for would I have come
Without mourning your love
All that I'm living for
All that I'm dying for
All that I can't ignore alone at night
All that I'm wanted for
Although I wanted more
Lock the last open door, my ghosts are gaining on me
Should it hurt to love you
Should I feel like I do
Should I lock the last open door, my ghosts are gaining on me`

I can't say no to you
Crave my heart and it's bleeding in your hand
I can't say no to you
Shouldn't let you torture me so sweetly
Now I can't let go of this dream
I can't breathe but I feel
Good enough
I feel good enough for you
Drink up sweet decadence
I can't say no to you
And I've completely lost myself and I don't mind
I can't say no to you
Shouldn't let you conquer me completely
Now I can't let go of this dream
Can't believe that I feel
Good enough
I feel good enough
It's been such a long time coming
But I feel good
And I'm still waiting for the rain to fall
Pour real life down on me
'Cause I can't hold on to anything
This good enough
Am I good enough
For you to love me too?
So take care what you ask of me
'Cause I can't say no`
